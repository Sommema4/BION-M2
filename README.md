# BION-M2

Scripts for programming the clock generator (I2C) and ADCs (SPI) through Raspberry Pi 3B+. Eventually, the firmware running on PIC microcontroller should do the programming of both devices. The programming with Rapsberry Pi is only for testing purposes.

Clock generator - 5P49V5913 Renesas (https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/document/dst/5p49v5913-datasheet)

ADCs - 12bit ADS 4129 Texas instruments (https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads4129.pdf?ts=1617257794146)

PIC microcontroller - PIC16LF18425 Microchip (https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40002002B.pdf)
